## Preparation

To prepare a meadowsweet infusion, steep 2 g of meadowsweet flowers (1 teaspoon) in 1 cup (250 mL) of boiling water (100°C) for 10-15 minutes and then strain.

A meadowsweet infusion can be taken anytime for pure enjoyment of its floral notes with a sweet aftertaste.

## Dosage and course of treatment

For acute, serious, and immediately present symptoms of the health issues described above, drink 1 cup during waking hours every one to two (1-2) hours. As symptoms subside, gradually space out the dose to one to two (1-2) cups daily.

For a chronic health issue drink 1 cup before meals three (3) times daily.

When using meadowsweet to treat or prevent a health issue, or relieve the symptoms, take the appropriate dose for at least 8 days. If your health issues has been remedied, you can stop taking doses on a regular basis.

If a regular basis is needed, drink 1 cup before meals three (3) times daily for eight (8) days. Let the body acclimate and stop taking doses for three (3) days before starting another 8 day treatment. Meadowsweet can be taken in this 8-days-on-3-days-off cycle continuously.

## Precautions

It’s always advised to consult your health professional and do your own research before starting any treatment to avoid interactions.

It’s best to avoid mixing medication and herbs within three (3) hours of each other, as many combinations have not been tried or tested. Meadowsweet is known to interact with aspirin, as both have similar effects.

If you’re on any medication, stay on it unless otherwise prescribed by your doctor.

Use smaller doses for children under 12, due to salicylate content. Meadowsweet should be avoided by those with a sensitivity to aspirin or salicylates.

Avoid meadowsweet during pregnancy, as it may stimulate uterine activity.

Meadowsweet flowers, like many natural products, contain pro-drugs. Pro-drugs are substances which must undergo a biotransformation inside the body (in vivo) to become an active medical drug.

Meadowsweet flowers naturally contain a group of compounds called salicylates. The primary ingredient in aspirin (acetyl-salicylic acid) is a salicylate and a pro-drug. Aspirin becomes the active compound salicylic acid inside the body.

A standard dose of aspirin contains approximately 325 mg of acetylsalicylic acid (99% pure) and is taken every 4-6 hours for general pain relief, inflammation, and swelling [Adult NSAID ref]. A dose of 2 g of meadowsweet flowers prepared in an infusion has less than 3 mg of methyl salicylate, the primary salicylate naturally present[ref Ollenikov].

Clearly, just the 3 mg of methyl salicylate present in a 2 g dose of meadowsweet flowers would give a lower level of pain relief than a dose of 325mg concentrated pharmaceutical strength aspirin.

However, 2 g of meadowsweet flowers contains about 270 mg of 119 different compounds [ref Olennikov, ref Bijttebier]. The major active compounds are salicylates, tannins, and phenolic compounds. The mixture of these compounds creates an overall effect that is safer than aspirin as will be explained below.

Firstly, it has been confirmed that that the tannins and phenolic compounds found in meadowsweet are partially responsible for the anti-ulcer, anti-fever (antipyretic), and anti-inflammatory properties. [ref Antioxidant, Anti-Inflammatory and Gastroprotective]

Aspirin, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), have been proven to provoke ulcers. [ref Cryer]  The probability of a person dying from a stomach (peptic) ulcer is low today, at 1 in 100,000. For a duodenal ulcer, the probability is much higher at 5 in 100 [ref what is the mortality rate].

An infusion from meadowsweet protects the body from ulcers forming in the first place (anti-ulcerogenic) [ref A Clinical Guide to, ref Braun,Lesley]. In an in vivo study done on rats, ulcers were induced using high doses of aspirin. Rats that were given meadowsweet infusions before the high dose of aspirin did not form ulcers. Furthermore, rats that already had stomach ulcers experienced higher healing when given meadowsweet infusions as treatment. [ref Barnaulov]

The anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving (analgesic) actions of meadowsweet flowers have been well studied and confirmed [Hoffmann, Lewis, Bone].
